        Our school is an incarnation of self-respect, love, affection, responsibility and compassion
        which allows the budding minds free to roam in the realm of imagination and experience to
        create a world of beauty in words. 

        I studied in SVMES since 2009 when I was 3 years old, starting from pre nursery 
        till 8th I have beeen studying here and I love my school and I will continue stodying here 
        till 10th. 
        Apart from studies my school encourages sports and extracurricular activities.
